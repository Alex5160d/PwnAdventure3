# Pwn Adventure 3

Welcome to this new [blog series](http://blog.keyidentity.com/tag/pwnadventure/) about [Pwn Adventure 3: Pwnie Island](http://pwnadventure.com/)! In this [series](http://blog.keyidentity.com/tag/pwnadventure/), we will cover different aspects of security that we often have to deal with during our penetration test, such as network analysis, reverse engineering and packet tampering.


PwnAdventure3 is a game developed by [Vector35](https://vector35.com/) for the [Ghost in the Shellcode](http://ghostintheshellcode.com/) 2015 CTF. The purpose of the game is to reverse engineer the GameLogic as well as the network in order to finish quests that would be impossible otherwise.
